          <p><a href='https://www.ifaw.org/'>IFAW's</a> tenBoma project is securing the Amboseli-Tsavo-Kilimanjaro (ATK) landscape and building resilience within it. tenBoma is doing this by preparing the landscape to better deal with current/emerging threats to wildlife and building a network between local communities, NGOs, and <a href='http://www.kws.go.ke/'>Kenya's Wildlife Service (KWS)</a> in order to quickly identify threats and react to that information in an effective way much faster than a monolithic organization ever could.<p>Operation Sisal Green employs Community Game Scouts that play a key role in enhancing the management of biodiversity and conservation not only in the Amboseli ecosystem and its dispersal areas but the entire scope of areas outside the protected zones/areas as well. These community scouts act as a bridge between government agencies, international organizations and the local community by closing the gap left due to factors such as the shortage of manpower and remoteness of some areas. They possess a rich and diverse knowledge of the local wildlife, their behaviors and the inherent characteristics of the communities they work within. IFAW's tenBoma Amboseli regional office, located in Kimana, is working closely with the ecosystem's Community Game Scouts. This is part of a stakeholders collaboration approach that aims in bringing together efforts and solutions that are geared towards sustainability of wildlife populations and promoting peaceful coexistence between people and wildlife.
